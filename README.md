📊 Bitcoin Price Analysis & Forecasting with Python

🔍 Project Overview

Welcome to the Bitcoin Price Analysis & Forecasting project! This project aims to explore the historical price data of Bitcoin (BTC), perform 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and use time series forecasting techniques to predict future price movements. Built in Python using Jupyter Notebook, 
the project includes several critical data science components such as data cleaning, visualization, and prediction modeling with Facebook Prophet.

This project will help you understand Bitcoin’s price trends, identify seasonal fluctuations, and forecast future prices using one of the most powerful 
open-source forecasting tools available.
